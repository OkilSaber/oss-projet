This is a simple snake game made in python 3.10 using the pygame library.

To run the game in dev mode run this command:
```
./script/start.sh
```
To build an executable run this command:
```
./script/build.sh
```
This will create an executable package suited for your OS (Linux, Windows and macos are supported). You can find the executable in this location: ``build/dist/``.

The ``Snake`` file is the executable.

Please note that if you want to move this executable somewhere else you ****MUST**** move the assets folder with it.
